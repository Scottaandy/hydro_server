# hydro_server
Simple hydroponics app that controls 2 pumps, a fan for a simple ebb-and-flow system.  This was written for my own use to experiment with growing peppers indoors.

The system consists of only a couple things:
    - Two tubs (one has holes cut in the lid where the plants are suspended, the other is underneath and holds the nutrients/water)
    - A red/blue/infra led light I got from Amazon at an incredible Lightning sale price.
    - 2 5 volt micro submersible pumps (One for circulating the water, one for pumping into the plant tub)
    - A Biocontrole Board (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/upsilon-engineering/biocontrole-aquaponic-and-hydroponic-raspberry-int)
    - A raspberry PI
    - A timer (for the light)
    - A large PC fan (12", 5volt)
    - Power supplies for the raspberry pi, biocontrole and the stuff off the relays
                      
The software is pretty basic, and I'm an amateur when it comes to Python, so don't crucify me :-)
    
I've been running it non-stop for at least 4 months at this point, and other than some leaf curl, I've had a good crop of peppers, and more are still growing!
